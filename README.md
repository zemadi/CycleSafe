<h1>CycleSafe</h1>

**CycleSafe** is a web app that allows cyclists to report dangerous road hazards, including construction, dangerous roads, and low visibility. 

This project was developed at the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/about/) on May 31, 2014, sponsored by [Code for San Jose](https://github.com/codeforsanjose).

More features will be added later!

**Who would use CycleSafe?**
•	Cyclists who ride a regular route and need to be prepared for any delays.
•	Cyclists looking to plan a ride in an unfamiliar area.
•	People looking for data to support bike road/trail improvements.

**Why would they use it?**
•	They are unfamiliar with an area.
•	They want an update or want to provide an update on existing conditions.
•	Future add-on: Trip planning from point-to-point.

**How would they use it?**
How to find information about hazards:
•	Select location to see if there are any hazards on their planned route.
•	Get more information by clicking on map points.

How to report hazards:
•	Click to select a location on the map.

•	Future add-on: upload a photo

<h2>Possible real-world uses for this app:</h2>
<h3>USE CASE 1 – Preventative Measures</h3>
Michelle bikes to work every day. Before she leaves, she pulls out her iPad and goes to the CycleSafe website. When the page loads, she sees there is a hazard along the road where she rides. She learns that there is road construction but it probably won’t prevent her from getting to work. She leaves the house knowing that she should look out for a hazard in that location. As she travels, she notices the reported hazard has been cleared. When she arrives at work she goes back to CycleSafe and provides an update. In the future, Michelle will be able to update items from a mobile app.

<h3>USE CASE 2 – Reporting a problem</h3>
On her way home from work, Michelle comes to a sudden stop along Santa Clara Street in front of the Sharks Arena. Traffic has been reduced to one lane in each direction due to construction of a new statue commemorating the Sharks Stanley Cup victory. Posted signs say the construction zone will be in effect until next month. When she gets home Michelle goes to the CycleSafe website and logs an incident in the system. In the future, Michelle can pull off to the side, snap a quick photo of the area with her smartphone and then automatically upload the photo with the incident report.

<h3>USE CASE 3 – Basic Trip Planning</h3>
John and Kathy are planning a day-long bike excursion. Typically they find an area and then start exploring. Today they are bringing their niece and nephew on the trip so they want to make sure the route is safe. Kathy fires up her browser and goes to the CycleSafe website. The page lists major incidents but she doesn’t see anything in her area. She then goes to the map and zooms in notes there are restaurants and rest stops along the way. In the future she may be able to create trip maps but for now she can at least see if there are any reports of trouble spots on her route. Seeing no major problems, they put on their helmets and protective pads, pack snacks and water and head out for the day.

<h3>FUTURE USE CASE – Use of the data collected</h3>
Once we have a significant pool of data, it can be analyzed for trends. Neighborhoods could use the data to identify areas of concern and work with cities and counties, state to make these areas safer.  

Develop a suggestion box for frequent users that allow for recommended travel paths or allow users to recommend improvement to bike lanes or trails (as an example if a new entry or exit path should be created to enter a trail either for access purposes or safety.
